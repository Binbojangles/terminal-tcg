## Status
Current Status: Ongoing
Last Update: 12/28/2024

##Description
Currently there is basic functionality to interact with the CLI via a menu consisting of four options.

1. Buy Cards
2. Set Prices
3. Sell Cards
4. Quit

These functions are pretty self explanitory. As of right now, starting cash is $1000. Cards are priced randomly, and purchased by name. They are then sold, and when sold a random customer is created which if within budget, will purchase a single card.

## To-Do
-Ability to sell multiple cards
-Randomly Generated Names for the cards (Something more creative than the current solution.)
-and so much more, that I'll list it all later.

TBC.
